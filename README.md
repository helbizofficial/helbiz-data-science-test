# helbiz-data-science-test

This is the technical test for the position "Software Engineer, Data" at Helbiz. It's designed to test your proficiency in API design, web scraping, cloud architecture, and general machine learning.

Design a system to read real-time data from all WASHINGTON GBFS feeds (see this repo: https://github.com/black-tea/swarm-of-scooters/blob/master/data/systems.csv), store in a db, and determine hotspots. A description of the design should include the tech stack, method of data collection and processing, cloud infrastructure used, and a general algorithm for hotspots - areas in the city that are most congested with scooters/bikes (hint: you should divide the map into equal hexagons of 75 meters to bunch coordinates together, try using Uber's [h3-js](https://github.com/uber/h3-js))

The components that should be developed are the web scraping and storing, as well as an API endpoint `/hotspots` that accepts parameters 
- geofence (string: `washington`)
- date (string: `2019-12-29`)

An example response for this endpoint could be a list of hexagon centers (lat/long) and their weight (relative to others) in terms of how congested they were for the given day.

## Get coding!
To start, fork this repository and submit a pull request with your finished app. We'll review and schedule a call so you can go over it with us. Be prepared to explain your code and why you made some of the decisions you made.
